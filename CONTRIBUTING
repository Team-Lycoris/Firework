# Contribution Guidelines

1. Fork the organization's repository.
2. Clone your fork onto your machine.
3. Create a new branch in your fork. (Name the branch according to the changes you'll make.)
4. Commit changes to the new branch.
5. Push your changes to Github. (Push to your fork, probably the "origin" remote repository.)
6. Submit a pull request to request merging changes into the organization repository.
7. Pull request is reviewed and hopefully eventually merged.
8. Pull changes from organization repository. (Probably from the "upstream" remote repository.)
9. Your changes should now be reflected in the main branch.

### Commit Naming
1. Every commit should have a proper commit message.
2. Try to start commit messages with a verb. Example: "Implement friend requests" or "Fix friend request bug"
