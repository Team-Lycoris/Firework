# Firework.Server

Setup:
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the server directory.
2. `npm install`
3. In the `src` directory, make a copy of `config.json.example` and rename it to `config.json`.
4. Edit `config.json` by supplying a string to use as the key used to sign JWTs. (For development purposes this can be pretty much any string.)
5. Run `node .` in the server directory.
